# IBM Event Automation

Today we will see how we can use IBM Event Automation (EA) to enable users to use real-time data to create new opportunities

EA consists out of 3 products:
 - IBM Event Streams
 - IBM Event Endpoint Management
 - IBM Event Processing
 
Each platform will have dedicated credentials. You will find the required credentials in the correct subfolder:
 - Event Streams\users\es-credentials.json
 - Event Endpoint Management\users\eem-credentials.json
 - Event Processing\users\ep-credentials

## The main exercise
### Goal
Build a kafka setup to provide your customers with real time pricing updates. The exercise will contain a mix of the following steps:
 - Creating topics
 - Defining avro contracts
 - Publishing topics (for producers and consumers)
 - Creating credentials and subscriptions
 - Creating Flink processes

## Extra challenge
Add a kafka application (which consumes from and produces to one or more kafka topics) to create a customer and link it to an existing meterId or EAN number. Get real-time notifications when the energy prices are favorable to charge your electric vehicle or when to stop charging.

For each excercise you will find a folder containing all the instructions.

Letâ€™s get started!
